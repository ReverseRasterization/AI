    "While the correlation between carbon dioxide emission and image count of an article is low (0.394 on the Pearson correlation scale), the probability that a randomly chosen article that emits more than the mean of CO2 and has more images than the mean of images among a dataset of 1000 articles is approximately 25.3%. This was answered by gathering the amount of images and emissions of 1000 articles from Scolarpedia using web crawling (for article discovery), web scraping (for article discovery and getting the amount of images), and utilizing the Website Carbon Calculator API (to calculate the emissions from said article). I then utilized the data to determine the mean, which states the average amount of images in an article is 14.03 images, and the average amount of carbon dioxide emissions is 0.205 grams. I then used a scatterplot and the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the correlation between the amount of images and the amount of emissions in the article; the scatterplot showed a weak, non-linear relationship, and the Pearson correlation coefficient came out to 0.3944, which demonstrates a rather weak relationship. Despite this, however, the theoretical probability that a randomly chosen article has more than the mean of images and emissions is 21.9% (219 articles out of the 1000); this was reflected when applied to Bayes theorem that came out to 25.3%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the probability that a randomly chosen article has more images and emissions than the means of both is 25.3%, granted a weak relationship between the two factors."
